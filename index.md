# Electric Gold
### The FPS game that goes to *32*
___
Electric Gold is a game inspired by many other FPS games, including **[Arsenal](https://web.roblox.com/games/286090429/Arsenal?refPageId=da7cd7fb-8629-4682-8a7c-25f5d0ddbfdb)** and **[Valorant](https://playvalorant.com)**. You have to be the first to get 32 kills while at least getting 6 kills with your special ability of choice. There are new skins, melees, avatars, and kill effects every month, so be sure to get the best ones.

## Credits

I'd like to thank the ROLVe Community and Riot Games for inspiring me to merge your games. Also, this game will be free! I am NOT making you pay for anything. There might be in-game purchasing, but that's it. All up to you.
